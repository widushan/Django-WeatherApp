# Django WeatherApp
A sleek and functional Weather Forecast web application built using Django. Users can search for any city to get real-time weather data including temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed. The app fetches live weather information from a public API (like OpenWeatherMap) and presents it in a clean, user-friendly interface.
